The Gunjo Foundation is dedicated to preserving and passing on records of telecommunications technology and modern maritime history, ensuring they are not lost to time.
The operations are based in Osaka, Japan, and Honiara, Solomon Islands.
The name “Gunjo” signifies “the blue beyond the sea”, symbolizing our deep connection to the ocean.
The Foundation was established on April 1, 2025, as a new organization succeeding all operations -- excluding memorial activities -- from its predecessor.
